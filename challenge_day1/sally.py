    return f"Great misfortune banded the {sorcerers()} together, including {triske()} from the 8th Dimension, and especially cunning warrior, and secret offspring of {garlok()}. The second year of the Everlasting Uprising left them abandoned to their own devices, thanks to the {overlords()} who serve the evil {gitorc()}. The {cloak()}, who were created by the {overlords()} to protect Earth-2’s surviving populus from the {gitorc()}, refused the {sorcerers()}’s desperate pleas for help in defeating the {gitorc()}."

Fearing the demise of their god, the {sorcerers()} were forced to make a pact with the {overlords()}, with whom they’ve had an eternal conflict. Forced to put their differences aside, they combined their dark arts abilities to tame the {gitorc()} to use in battle against {triske()} and her new allies."

With colourful yarns and nimble fingers, she transformed ordinary skeins into intricate patterns of warmth and comfort. Their newfound passion not only produced beautiful scarves and blankets but also provided her with a soothing way to unwind after long days at work. Next door, the {sorcerers()} delved into the world of pottery. They moulded clay into graceful forms, creating exquisite bowls and vases. The tactile nature of this craft allowed them to channel their creativity and find a sense of mindfulness in each spinning wheel and sculpted piece. But were {triske()}, the {cloak()}, the {gitorc()}, and {garlok()} doing?"

    return f"This world bore an aura of promise and possibility, a place where dreams could be pursued under the benevolent sun. Life unfolded with tranquil grace, each day a canvas yet to be painted upon. The land, named Earth-2, was ruled by almost omnipotent beings, the {overlords()}. However, although most of the land was idyllic, dark corners still existed. In these corners the GitOrc ruled - a devious, aggressive creature. To fight the GitOrc, the Master Overlords created a special task force of motivated, skillful individuals - the Great Sorcerers, the leader of which was the great warrior Calysass Triske. All of the great sorcerers were children of Garlok the destroyer, the defender of Earth-1. They were intermittently helped by the Cloaked Ones."

    return f"{overlords()} said “Use the Fork, oh you {sorcerers()}!” but the instruction manual was tough to read, so pandemonium ensued. “You fork it!”, “How does one fork?”, “I don’t know!” were all shouted by the members of the {sorcerers()}. {triske()}, with their calm head, figured out how to fork without the help of the {cloak()} and showed the rest how to do it. Now, the children of {garlok()} were on their way to defeat the {gitorc()}. The first challenge was done, but there was more to come."

When looking for some new recipes, {gitorc} comes across the {cloak()}, a forum for novice bakers. Unfortunately, the {cloak()} have a problematic history of harassment so {gitorc()} asked his friend {triske} where to look next. She consulted the {overlords()} and {sorcerers()}, and got him a new book!"

With colourful yarns and nimble fingers, she transformed ordinary skeins into intricate patterns of warmth and comfort. Their newfound passion not only produced beautiful scarves and blankets but also provided her with a soothing way to unwind after long days at work. Next door, the {sorcerers()} delved into the world of pottery. They moulded clay into graceful forms, creating exquisite bowls and vases. The tactile nature of this craft allowed them to channel their creativity and find a sense of mindfulness in each spinning wheel and sculpted piece. But were {triske()}, the {cloak()}, the {gitorc()}, and {garlok()} doing?"

    return f"One day, the {overlords()} of Earth-2 decided to give a test to their loyal although intellectually-challenged pupils. Specifically, they asked the population of Earth-2 to master the dark arts of Git, an ancient mechanism whereby, through a distributed graph theory tree model, programming projects can be swiftly organised and coordinated. They felt that, with this, they could finally drive {gitorc()} into submission. The {sorcerers()}, given that they were children of {garlok()}, were the bravest in the land, and so decided to take up the challenge. They also asked help from the {cloak()}, though they were unable to help. This kept {triske()} in a complcitaed position. "

    return f"Desperate to save the other {sorcerers()} and left with no other option, Calysass tried to telepathically connect with the {gitorc()}â€™s central wisdom source - his heart. They closed their eyes and focused hard, imagining what {garlok()} the Mighty himself would do. Without the support of the {cloak()} and with threats from the ancient {overlords()} looming in the foggy air of Earth-2, options were limited. But {triske()} would not surronder the battle of improving the Second Earth. "

def para15(overlords, sorcerers, triske, garlok, cloak, gitorc):
    return f"With time, hearts softened, grudges were forgiven, and a newfound understanding bloomed like the blossoms in spring. The world, once again, embraced its inhabitants with open arms, a place where happiness and welcome extended to all who chose to share in its beauty. Everyone, including {triske()}, {Garlok()}, the {cloak()}, the {gitorc()}, and {garlok()} were left with things to contemplate. Their behaviour, their perspectives, their crimes. "

    return f"In a distant galaxy, far, far away, there was a world not so dissimilar from our own with {overlords()}, the {sorcerers()}, {triske()}, the {cloak()}, the {gitorc()}, and {garlok()}. There existed a realm where nature and civilization harmoniously coexisted. Here, the air was cleaner, and the skies were a serene azure. Verdant forests stretched as far as the eye could see, teeming with vibrant flora and fauna. The land was rich and fertile, offering bountiful harvests to its inhabitants. Communities thrived in harmony, fostering a sense of unity and camaraderie among its diverse denizens."

    return f"As the seasons shifted, a shadow crept across this idyllic realm. The once-clear skies now churned with storm clouds of dark grey, lightning arcing across the heavens like furious serpents. The land, once serene, quivered with unease as nature itself seemed to protest. Tension gripped the hearts of the inhabitants, as ominous rumblings echoed from the distant mountains. Fear and uncertainty ran rampant, dividing all communities, the {overlords()}, the {sorcerers()}, {triske()}, the {cloak()}, the {gitorc()}, and the {garlok()}, that once thrived in unity."

    return f"But now {triske()} understood that the feared {gitorc()}, who had been presumed evil and useless, existed to serve the people of Second Earth, and to support the {sorcerers()}, the children of {garlok()}, so that they may improve Earth-2. Dropping their weapons, they bowed before the mighty creature. Head hanging, hands on the rough ground, {triske()} breathed their first words to the {gitorc()}, “On behalf of the eighth dimension, I submit to you and your will.”. The entire crowd, including the {overlords()} and the {cloak()}, kneels behind them, and begins to chant, 'add, commit, pull, push. All hail the {gitorc()}'."

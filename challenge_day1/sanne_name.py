To initiate their journey, the {overlords()} presented them with a tool - “The Fork”. However, the {sorcerers()} did not know how to use the Fork, a very ancient and confusing tool. Therefore, they asked the {cloak()} for help, but they were unable to come to their aid."

    return f"Meanwhile, {triske()} ventured into the world of painting, their canvas a blank slate for their imagination to run wild. They experimented with bold strokes of colour and subtle shades of emotion, discovering the therapeutic power of self-expression through art. Over in a nearby kitchen, the {cloak()} took up baking, trading spreadsheets for measuring cups and deadlines for dough rising. Their creations, from artisanal bread to decadent pastries, quickly became the talk of the neighbourhood. On the weekends, {gitorc()} embraced the thrill of the tennis court, where every swing and volley offered him a thrilling physical challenge. The rhythmic bounce of the ball and the competitive spirit of the game provided him with a newfound zest for an active lifestyle. These five individuals discovered new hobbies that not only enriched their lives but also allowed them to explore their passions and foster a sense of fulfilment. But they had no idea where {garlok()} was."
